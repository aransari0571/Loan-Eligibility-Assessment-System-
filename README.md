Loan Eligibility Assessment System

📌 Project Overview
This project is a Machine Learning–based Loan Eligibility Assessment System that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on applicant financial details.
The system automates decision-making and reduces manual effort using a trained ML classification model deployed via Flask.

🎯 Objective
To build an end-to-end ML application that:
•. Predicts loan approval accurately
•. Reduces human bias and processing time
•. Provides real-time predictions through a web interface

🛠️ Tech Stack
Programming Language: 
•. Python
•. Framework: Flask
•. Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
•. Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
•. Model Deployment: Pickle
•. Frontend: HTML, CSS

📊 Features
•. Data preprocessing (handling missing values & encoding)
•. ML model training and evaluation
•. Real-time loan approval prediction
•. Simple and user-friendly web interface
•. Production-ready ML model integration

🧠 Machine Learning Workflow
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Feature Engineering
3. Model Training (Classification Algorithms)
4. Model Selection & Optimization
5. Model Serialization using Pickle
6. Deployment using Flask
